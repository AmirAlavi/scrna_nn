  Comparing: regular siamese vs "flexible" siamese vs "even flexible" siamese
  Models trained on 2017-09-20 and 2017-09-29
  - "flexible" siamese: models trained with the new, flexible Contrastive Loss function
  - "even flexible" siamese: models trained with the same loss function as "flexible" siamese, but the data pair generation
    process evenly distributes the "different" pairs among the different distances. (expected to do better).
  - Need to also try a new metric in the retrieval that is not restricted to calculating scores only at recall positions where
    there is a perfect match.

  Same as the experiment above, but with a new retrieval metric which computes the score at every recall position, instead of only
  at exact matches.
